        RAID6TP: A placement policy that uses parity-based protection for storing
          stripes of 'n' logical blocks of data and three logical blocks of independent
          parity across a set of 'n+3' independent storage devices where the parity
          and data blocks are interleaved across the storage devices.
      x-enumLongDescriptions:
        None: A placement policy with no redundancy at the device level.
        RAID0: A placement policy where consecutive logical blocks of data are uniformly
          distributed across a set of independent storage devices without offering
          any form of redundancy. This is commonly referred to as data striping. This
          form of RAID will encounter data loss with the failure of any storage device
          in the set.
        RAID00: A placement policy that creates a RAID 0 stripe set over two or more
          RAID 0 sets. This is commonly referred to as RAID 0+0. This form of data
          layout is not fault tolerant; if any storage device fails there will be
          data loss.
        RAID01: A data placement policy that creates a mirrored device (RAID 1) over
          a set of striped devices (RAID 0). This is commonly referred to as RAID
          0+1 or RAID 0/1. Data stored using this form of RAID is able to survive
          a single RAID 0 data set failure without data loss.
        RAID1: A placement policy where each logical block of data is stored on more
          than one independent storage device. This is commonly referred to as mirroring.
          Data stored using this form of RAID is able to survive a single storage
          device failure without data loss.
        RAID10: A placement policy that creates a striped device (RAID 0) over a set
          of mirrored devices (RAID 1). This is commonly referred to as RAID 1/0.
          Data stored using this form of RAID is able to survive storage device failures
          in each RAID 1 set without data loss.
        RAID10E: A placement policy that uses a RAID 0 stripe set over two or more
          RAID 10 sets. This is commonly referred to as Enhanced RAID 10. Data stored
          using this form of RAID is able to survive a single device failure within
          each nested RAID 1 set without data loss.
        RAID10Triple: A placement policy that uses a striped device (RAID 0) over
          a set of triple mirrored devices (RAID 1Triple). This form of RAID can survive
          up to two failures in each triple mirror set without data loss.
        RAID1E: A placement policy that uses a form of mirroring implemented over
          a set of independent storage devices where logical blocks are duplicated
          on a pair of independent storage devices so that data is uniformly distributed
          across the storage devices. This is commonly referred to as RAID 1 Enhanced.
          Data stored using this form of RAID is able to survive a single storage
          device failure without data loss.
        RAID1Triple: A placement policy where each logical block of data is mirrored
          three times across a set of three independent storage devices. This is commonly
          referred to as three-way mirroring. This form of RAID can survive two device
          failures without data loss.
        RAID3: "A placement policy using parity-based protection where logical bytes\
          \ of data are uniformly distributed across a set of independent storage\
          \ devices and where the parity is stored on a dedicated independent storage\
          \ device. Data stored using this form of RAID is able to survive a single\
          \ storage device failure without data loss. If the storage devices use rotating\
          \ media, they are assumed to be rotationally synchronized, and the data\
          \ stripe size should be no larger than the exported block size."
        RAID4: A placement policy using parity-based protection where logical blocks
          of data are uniformly distributed across a set of independent storage devices
          and where the parity is stored on a dedicated independent storage device.
          Data stored using this form of RAID is able to survive a single storage
          device failure without data loss.
        RAID5: A placement policy using parity-based protection for storing stripes
          of 'n' logical blocks of data and one logical block of parity across a set
          of 'n+1' independent storage devices where the parity and data blocks are
          interleaved across the storage devices. Data stored using this form of RAID
          is able to survive a single storage device failure without data loss.
        RAID50: A placement policy that uses a RAID 0 stripe set over two or more
          RAID 5 sets of independent storage devices. Data stored using this form
          of RAID is able to survive a single storage device failure within each RAID
          5 set without data loss.
        RAID6: A placement policy using parity-based protection for storing stripes
          of 'n' logical blocks of data and two logical blocks of independent parity
          across a set of 'n+2' independent storage devices where the parity and data
          blocks are interleaved across the storage devices. Data stored using this
          form of RAID is able to survive any two independent storage device failures
          without data loss.
        RAID60: A placement policy that uses a RAID 0 stripe set over two or more
          RAID 6 sets of independent storage devices. Data stored using this form
          of RAID is able to survive two device failures within each RAID 6 set without
          data loss.
        RAID6TP: A placement policy that uses parity-based protection for storing
          stripes of 'n' logical blocks of data and three logical blocks of independent
          parity across a set of 'n+3' independent storage devices where the parity
          and data blocks are interleaved across the storage devices. This is commonly
          referred to as Triple Parity RAID. Data stored using this form of RAID is
          able to survive any three independent storage device failures without data
          loss.
